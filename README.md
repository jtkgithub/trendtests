# trendtests
R-code for a collection of trend tests and some examples of use. 

The oldest files give code for tests, data and examples presented  
in the manuscript "A Class of Tests for Trend in Time Censored 
Recurrent Event Data", Technometrics 2020.

The newest files give code for tests, data and examples presented  
in the manuscript "New Tests for Trend in Time Censored Recurrent
Event Data", accepted for publication in Applied Stochastic Models in 
Business and Industry 2024.

The file trendtests.R contain trend tests for single processes. 
See information about the tests and the code at the beginning of the file.
Examples of use are given in example_LHDdata.R.

The file trendtests_multi.R contain trend tests for multiple processes.
See information about the tests and the code at the beginning of the file.
Examples of use are given in example_LHDdata_multi.R.

The file Trendtests.R give code for further tests for single processes, 
presented in the 2024 paper. Examples of use are given in LHDdata_example.R
and USSHalfbeakdata_example.R. The data sets used for these examples are 
also given in these files. Code for simulating the asymptotic null distribution 
of some of the tests is given in SimAsympTestDistr.R
